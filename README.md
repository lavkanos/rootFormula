# Way of implementation:
### ! = variable created by our code, not the user

1. Getting value of a,b,c from user
2. Then calculating -4 * a * c (!Yellow)
3. adding b^2 to Yellow (!Red)
4. Getting square root of Red (!sqrtred)
5. Creating a variable named a2 which contains 2 * a
6. And finally

X1 = -(b) - !sqrtred / !a2

X2 = -(b) + !sqrtred / !a2
